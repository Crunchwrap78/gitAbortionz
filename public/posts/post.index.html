    <p class="panel panel-default panel-body">The landscape for abortion access is changing. Many states have passed laws that make it more difficult for a woman to choose to end a pregnancy, while some have gone the other direction and passed laws to protect a woman's right to choose. Our hope is that by encouraging women to share their stories, we can  start a new and more personal conversation about abortion in America, and where we go from here.</p>
